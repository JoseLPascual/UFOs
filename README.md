# UFOs

## Project Overview
The purpose of this document is to describe how Dana's site works now that multiple criteria can be selected at once.

## Resources
- Data Sources: index.html, style.css, app.js, data.js, nasa.jpg
- Software: Microsoft Visual Studio 1.57.1

## Results
How one may use this updated website is as follows:
-There are five search options from which a user can choose.
-In addition to selecting a date (in m/dd/yyyy format,) a user can now select for city, state, country, and shape.

On the lower-left of the screen is where the search bars are found.  The user needs to fill out at least one of five possible search options, namely being date (Enter Date), city (Enter a City), state (Enter a State), country (Enter a Country), and shape (Enter a Shape).  After doing so, the user then clicks on Filter Table to retrieve the desired results.

# Summary
One drawback I noticed while designing this website is that one cannot click on a given criterion title to sort in a given order, e.g. in alphabeteical order for the city criterion.  I recommend that for future development, that criterion titles be sortable upon being clicked by the user.  Another suggestion, one more drawn-out in terms of development, would be to link each result to its own web page that explains in exact detail the given occurrence.
